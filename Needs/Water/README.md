# Water
The most abundant, yet so scarce in terms of usable resource. It is also one of the most powerful resource, that could determine the existance or competely wipe out a civilization. This is one resource that everyone respects and also fights vehemently for its possession. Let's conserve this, as it is one of the most important resource that will keep humans sane and rightful or completely turn on each other if not managed well.
 # Potable Water
 Potable Water is rapidly becoming a luxury, although it is abundant enough for all life to thrive. So our first module will be to provide solutions for usage, managing, recyling and conservation techniques with technology for all things Water.
  # Potable Water Management
  Modern homes are equipped with an electric water pump up to storage tanks. However, it is at this very stage we see a major loophole in the wastage when it overflows once the tank is full. A Modular Automated Water Level Controller should help in addressing this issue.
  # [Water Level Controller](Water Level Controller)
   This will be the first ever module that is an absolute necessity, also one of the most affordable, so implemented by almost everyone. Having a smart, connected and yet being affordable is key, so we are designing it here.
