# Water Manager
Modern homes are equipped with an electric water pump up to storage tanks. However, it is at this very stage we see a major loophole in the wastage when it overflows once the tank is full. A Modular Automated Water Level Controller should help in addressing this issue.
 # Potable Water Monitor
 Water can be called potable only when it is safe enough to consume or use without any danger when we come in contact with it.

 Contamination is an issue, and as we all know that organic matter in the water can decompose rendering it as non-potable. Also inroganic contaminants can also dissolve or suspend in it making it unusable. However, there are a few devices which can monitor some of these contaminants and this is what this module is all about.
