 Water can be called potable only when it is safe enough to consume or use without any danger when we come in contact with it.

 Contamination is an issue, and as we all know that organic matter in the water can decompose rendering it as non-potable. Also inroganic contaminants can also dissolve or suspend in it making it unusable. However, there are a few devices which can monitor some of these contaminants and this is what this module is all about.

# [Water Manager](../WaterManager/)
Modern homes have atleast one tank for holding potable water. It is very important to keep it clean and hygienic enough to be able to use it without any risks or hazard.

## [Water Level Controller](../WaterLevelController/)
 This will be the first ever module that is an absolute necessity, also one of the most affordable, so implemented by almost everyone. Having a smart, connected and yet being affordable is key, so we are designing it here.

## [Gray Water System](../GrayWaterSystem)
 Gray water is usually discarded as waste water into the drainage/sewage line. This is a huge loss of useable water resource which can be used for secondary purposes with minimal treatment/filtration systems.
