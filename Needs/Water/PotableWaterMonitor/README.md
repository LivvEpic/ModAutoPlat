# Potable Water Monitor
Water can be called potable only when it is safe enough to consume or use without any danger when we come in contact with it.

Contamination is an issue, and as we all know that organic matter in the water can decompose rendering it as non-potable. Also inroganic contaminents can also dissolve or suspend in it making it unusable. However, there are a few devices which can monitor some of these contaminents and this is what this module is all about.
