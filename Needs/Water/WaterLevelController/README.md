 This will be the first ever module that is an absolute necessity, also one of the most affordable, so implemented by almost everyone. Having a smart, connected and yet being affordable is key, so we are designing it here.

# [Water Manager](../WaterManager/)
Modern homes are equipped with an electric water pump up to storage tanks. However, it is at this very stage we see a major loophole in the wastage when it overflows once the tank is full. A Modular Automated Water Level Controller should help in addressing this issue.

## [Potable Water Monitor](../PotableWaterMonitor/)
 Potable Water is rapidly becoming a luxury, although it is abundant enough for all life to thrive. So our first module will be to provide solutions for usage, managing, recyling and conservation techniques with technology for all things Water.

## [Gray Water System](../GrayWaterSystem)
 Gray water is usually discarded as waste water into the drainage/sewage line. This is a huge loss of useable water resource which can be used for secondary purposes with minimal treatment/filtration systems.
