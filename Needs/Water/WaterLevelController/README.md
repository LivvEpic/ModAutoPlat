 Modern homes have atleast one tank for holding potable water. It is very important to keep it clean and hygienic enough to be able to use it without any risks or hazard. This will be the first ever module that is an absolute necessity, also one of the most affordable, so implemented by almost everyone. Having a smart, connected and yet being affordable is key, so we are designing it here.

# [Water Manager](../WaterManager/)
A system which manages all the water resources, fresh/raw, potable, gray, to black. Nothing is waste if we know how to use it.

## [Potable Water Monitor](../PotableWaterMonitor/)
 Potable Water is rapidly becoming a luxury, although it is abundant enough for all life to thrive. So our first module will be to provide solutions for usage, managing, recyling and conservation techniques with technology for all things Water.

## [Gray Water System](../GrayWaterSystem)
 Gray water is usually discarded as waste water into the drainage/sewage line. This is a huge loss of useable water resource which can be used for secondary purposes with minimal treatment/filtration systems.
