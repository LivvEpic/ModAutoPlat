# ModAutoPlat
Modular Automation Platform system for all things &amp; process to be automated.

The main intention of platform is to help everyone of us to strive towards sustainability. Since human population is expanding and the resources are limited basically to what it is, we need quickly to learn, adapt and improvise the way we use it. Rather than fighting over resources, it is more humanly to share, preserve and make things better for the future.

We consider the basic resources such as water, air, food and shelter is a necessity, hence, everything else is considered luxury.

Water
Potable Water is rapidly becoming a luxury, although it is abundant enough for all life to thrive. So our first module will be to provide solutions for usage , recyling and conservation techniques of all things Water.
